<h1 align='center'> Conway, AI Assistant ðŸ¤– </h1>
Conway is an AI-based helper extension designed to provide assistance to users across multiple platforms using GPT-3 technology. 
Once activated, the extension accepts any request from the user and provides relevant assistance based on the input.

# Features
* The AI-based helper extension eliminates the need for users to copy and paste their problems into ChatGPT repeatedly.
* The extension accepts any request from the user directly where they are.
* By eliminating the need for additional authentication steps and reducing the time and effort required to complete tasks, the extension optimizes the user workflow, resulting in a more efficient and satisfying experience.
